/*Design a class named 'x' having two attributes i and j of the type int. Let it have a constructor that takes in two argument of type int and assign them to i and j.Let it also have a method name final sum that compute the sum of i and j that return it.Let a class 'y' extend class x,lets it have its own constructer and method name find product that compute and return i*j. lets a class Z extend a class Y.Design a class name multilevel inheritance demo it must have the main method in which the object of class Z is constructed and all the methods(its own and the inherited one ) are invokeand the sum difference and the product are display. */
